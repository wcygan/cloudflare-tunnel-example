## Next Actions

### Immediate Priority (Next 2 Days)
1. **Start Checkpoint 1.1**: Initialize Cargo project and implement basic Axum service
2. **Prepare environment**: Install Rust, Docker, and Deno if not already available
3. **Create project structure**: Set up initial directory layout per PLAN.md

### This Week
1. Complete Phase 1 (Checkpoints 1.1 and 1.2)
2. Set up Cloudflare account and domain for tunnel configuration
3. Begin Checkpoint 2.1 tunnel configuration

### Upcoming Decisions
- **Domain selection**: Choose domain for tunnel endpoint
- **Container registry**: Confirm ghcr.io access or select alternative
- **Load testing tools**: Select tools for performance validation
