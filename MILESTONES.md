# MILESTONES.md - Project Progress Tracking

This file tracks the completion status of all project milestones and provides guidance for next steps.

## Current Status Overview

**Project Phase**: Foundation Setup Complete → Cloudflare Integration
**Overall Progress**: 20% (2/10 checkpoints completed)
**Next Milestone**: 2.1 - Tunnel Configuration

---

## Phase 1: Core Service Foundation (Week 1)

### ✅ Checkpoint 1.1: Rust Axum Service Implementation
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED on 2025-06-15
**Actual Effort**: 3 hours

**Completed Deliverables**:
- [x] Initialize Cargo workspace with Axum dependencies
- [x] Implement "Hello World" endpoint with health checks  
- [x] Configure service for container deployment (0.0.0.0:8080 binding)
- [x] Add HTTP security headers middleware

**Success Criteria Validated**:
- ✅ Service responds with "Hello World" at localhost:8080
- ✅ Health check endpoint returns 200 OK with JSON response
- ✅ Security headers present in response (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
- ✅ Code follows Rust best practices (cargo fmt, clippy passing)

**Lessons Learned**:
- Axum middleware signature has changed in recent versions - needed to adapt from generic parameters
- Security headers middleware implementation is straightforward with tower-http
- chrono dependency required for timestamp in health check

**Next Steps**:
- Begin Checkpoint 1.2: Multi-Stage Dockerfile implementation
- Create builder stage with cargo-chef for dependency caching
- Implement distroless runtime with security hardening

---

### ✅ Checkpoint 1.2: Multi-Stage Dockerfile
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED on 2025-06-15
**Actual Effort**: 4 hours

**Completed Deliverables**:
- [x] Create builder stage with Rust toolchain and cargo-chef caching
- [x] Implement distroless runtime stage with security hardening
- [x] Configure non-root user (1000:1000) and read-only filesystem
- [x] Validate image size and startup time

**Success Criteria Validated**:
- ✅ Docker build completes successfully
- ⚠️ Final image size 36.2MB (larger than 15MB target due to Rust binary size)
- ✅ Container starts in 0.244 seconds (well under 5s target)
- ✅ Service runs as non-root user (1000:1000)
- ✅ Multi-arch build support verified (amd64/arm64)

**Lessons Learned**:
- cargo-chef significantly improves build caching for Rust projects
- Size optimizations (LTO, strip, opt-level=z) help but Rust binaries remain large
- distroless/cc-debian12 provides excellent security with minimal overhead
- Multi-arch builds work seamlessly with docker buildx

**Next Steps**:
- Begin Phase 2: Cloudflare Integration
- Create cloudflared configuration with ingress rules
- Set up Docker Compose for service orchestration
